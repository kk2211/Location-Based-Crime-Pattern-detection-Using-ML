A division bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal granted four weeks to file a response on the petition of Siddharth Vashisht, also known as Manu Sharma. The court will take up the matter on December 16.

Sharma is serving life term for murdering Jessica Lal in south Delhi's Mehrauli in April, 1999.

The Delhi government sought time to file its response on Sharma's petition, which was filed through advocate Amit Sahni.

Sharma has completed almost 23 years (with remission) and 17 years (without remission) in jail, the petition said, adding that he is aggrieved by the Delhi government's September 19 order upholding the recommendation of Sentence Review Board (SRB), which decides on the release of prisoners sentenced for life.

The board had rejected Sharma's petition for early release on July 19 this year.

The petition said the board had rejected Sharma's petition in spite of fulfilling ""all required parameters"" and called its decision as ""unfair, arbitrary impartial"".

""This is not for the first time, that the SRB has chosen to reject the petitioner's case for release, earlier too on three occasions, the case of the petitioner has been rejected by SRB in an unfair manner for extraneous reasons, despite fulfilling all required parameters and prescribed conditions,"" it submitted.

It said, ""Aggrieved by the earlier rejection order the Manu stated that his rejection is unreasoned and cryptic manner which were contrary to the facts on record in an unfair and biased manner.""

In September this year, Sharm's wife, Preity Sharma, had approached the Human Rights Commission (NHRC) alleging that gross violation of Human Rights and stated that her husband is illegally detained for more than the prescribed period of incarceration (20 years with remission).

Jessica was shot by Sharma, the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma, when she refused to serve him liquor at Tamarind Court restaurant at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on April 29, 1999.

Jessica's sister, Sabrina Lall, had written a letter to Tihar Jail for Sharma's early release, saying that she had no objection to his release.	Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma, who has spent about 17 years in jail, has sought premature release and the Delhi High Court Friday asked the Delhi government to respond to his plea.

A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal asked the Delhi government to file its reply on the petition in which Sharma has challenged the July 19 decision of Sentence Review Board (SRB) rejecting his case for release.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on December 16.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Sharma, sought his release while relying on the high court's judgement by which Tandoor murder case convict Sushil Sharma was granted premature release.

""The petitioner qualifies all the requisite parameters as stipulated in minutes of meetings of SRB. Further incarceration of the petitioner after completion of maximum prescribed period, that is, 20 years (including remission), in absence of cogent and compelling reasons, is unlawful and without legal justification,"" said the plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni.

""The recommendations dated July 19, 2019 of SRB rejecting the case of petitioner for pre-mature release is contrary to law and not based on facts and is liable to be set aside,"" it said.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra said for the last three years, Sharma was in semi-open jail and now he is in open jail. He said it has been held by the Supreme Court that life imprisonment means till natural life.

Sharma said in his plea SRB has rejected the plea in an arbitrary and impartial manner and even earlier also, the authorities have rejected his plea on three occasions.

Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.

The trial court had acquitted him, but the Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.

NEW DELHI: Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma on Friday moved Delhi high court challenging the rejection of his plea for premature release by the Sentence Review Board (SRB) of the state government.A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal asked the Delhi government to file its reply on the petition by Sharma against the July 19 decision of the SRB rejecting his case for release.Sharma, who has spent nearly 17 years in jail, has cited the HC verdict on Tandoor murder case convict Sushil Sharma who was granted premature release.""The petitioner qualifies all the requisite parameters as stipulated in minutes of meetings of SRB. Further incarceration of the petitioner after completion of maximum prescribed period, that is, 20 years (including remission), in absence of cogent and compelling reasons, is unlawful and without legal justification,"" said the plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni. ""The recommendations dated July 19, 2019 of SRB rejecting the case of petitioner for pre-mature release is contrary to law and not based on facts and is liable to be set aside,"" it added.However, prosecution opposed the plea arguing that for the last three years, Sharma was in semi-open jail and now he is in open jail and it has been held by the Supreme Court that life imprisonment means till natural life.But the convict questioned the rejection by SRB, arguing that it has been done in an arbitrary manner and even earlier, the authorities had rejected his plea on three occasions.Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lall in 1999.The trial court had acquitted him, but Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.Lall was shot dead by Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at the Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on the night of April 30, 1999.	The wife of Manu Sharma, a convict in Jessica Lal murder case, has approached the Human Right Commission (NHRC) for his release, alleging human rights violation.

Sidharth Vashisht alias Manu Sharma is serving a life term in Tihar Jail for murdering Jessica Lal in 1999.

Jessica's sister Sabrina Lall had written a letter to Tihar Jail for Sharma's early release, saying that she had no objection to his release.

Jessica was shot by Manu when she refused to serve liquor to him at Tamarind Court restaurant, owned by socialite and designer Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on April 29, 1999.

Manu Sharma is the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma.	The wife of Manu Sharma, a convict in Jessica Lal murder case, on Wednesday approached the Human Right Commission (NHRC) for his release, alleging human rights violation.

Manu's wife Preity Sharma through her advocate Amit Sahni approached the NHRC, alleging the gross violation of her husband's human rights.

She has claimed that her husband had been illegally detained for more than the prescribed period of incarceration (20 years with remission) as per the prevalent policy of the state.

""The policy clearly reads that cases falling in Clause 3.1 of the SRB order such as her husband's case should not be detained for more than 20 years with remission and having fulfilled all the parameters as laid down in the state policy of the government and as per recommendations of the NHRC guidelines,"" she has stated in her plea.

Manu Sharma, originally Siddharth Vashisht, is serving life term for murdering model Jessica Lal in 1999.

His detention beyond the maximum prescribed period in a whimsical and arbitrary manner tantamount to illegal and unlawful detention and is violative of his basic human rights as enriched in Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, she further said.

Preity submitted that Delhi's Sentence Review Board (SRB) rejected Sharma's plea for premature release for ""extraneous reasons on four occasions"" even as he fulfills all factors which are to be considered to make a decision.

She said that the board extended benefit of ""premature release to convicts who were involved in much more serious offences and who did not even fulfill the prescribed parameters"" and alleged ""malpractice and violation"" of law in the decision making which, she said, was in complete ""violation of constitutional rights and human rights of my husband.""

Advocate Sahni urged the NHRC to protect the human rights of Manu Sharma by passing appropriate directions to ""uphold the law and stop the blatant violation of his human rights being done without having sufficient cause.""

In January, the Delhi High Court disposed of Sharma's plea seeking premature release from the prison.

A sex worker was murdered and her body chopped into several pieces for refusing to give up prostitution and marry her partner. The two shocking murders reported earlier this month have been solved with the police arresting the accused in both cases, police said on Saturday. The first murder was reported on August 6, when a woman’s body was found stuffed in a gunny bag in southwest Delhi’s Sagarpur. The suspect, her husband, has been arrested from Kolkata. The second case was reported on August 20, when the pieces of a woman’s body was found stuffed in bag near Bawana canal.

Her pictures were also circulated in the WhatsApp groups and shared on social media sites, Arya said.“On August 17, the woman was identified as Fatema Sardar by one of her relatives from 24 Parganas South, West Bengal. The relative told us that she was living in Delhi with her husband Jalil Sheikh. Further probe revealed that Sheikh had left for West Bengal the same day on which the woman’s body was found. We immediately sent a team to West Banal but found that Sheikh had already left his native place and switched off his mobile phone,” Arya said.The DCP said Sheikh’s family members and relatives were questioned and on Wednesday, he was arrested from Ballygaunje Railway Station in Kolkata.Fatema’s father and uncle also identified her and alleged that Sheikh used to demand dowry from her. Arya said, during interrogation Sheikh disclosed he had two wives, one in West Bengal and another in Delhi. “He said about seven years ago, he and Fatema started living in Delhi and then got married in 2014. Sheikh repeatedly tried to force her into prostitution but she resisted. Agitated by her stubbornness he strangled her using a chunni on August 6. He then wrapped her body in a blanket and a plastic sack before dumping it on a secluded stretch in Sagarpur. He said he had also been arrested in a human trafficking case in West Bengal,” the DCP said.In the second case reported on August 20, police said the victim was identified as a sex worker from GB Road.

But, despite this, the decision to use a refrigerator to discreetly move the body of Kishan Dev Khosla from his house in Greater Kailash to the burial site was taken on the spur of the moment, said Parvinder Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (south) [ADCP].Through Monday, police arrested five suspects, including Khosla’s full-time domestic help and alleged mastermind, 25-year-old Kishan. Singh quoted Kishan as claiming that he had killed Khosla for “scolding him frequently”, and to rob him. However, Singh said other motives were still being probed.“Kishan had taken a small house on rent in Sangam Vihar on August 28 and dug a five-foot deep pit nearby,” said Singh.Kundesh Gupta, a resident of the Sangam Vihar neighbourhood, said, “They said they were constructing a water storage tank. Since Sangam Vihar grapples with water problems, we believed them,” said Gupta.ADCP Singh said that the probe revealed that Kishan had offered tea laced with sedatives to Khosla and his 87-year-old wife, Saroj, Saturday. “Once the couple were unconscious, Kishan called five of his associates who arrived in a goods carrier owned by Sangam Vihar resident Pradeep Sharma,” said Singh.While Sharma was also arrested, his neighbour Brijpal Upadhyay said that he may not have been aware of the murder plot. “When some people (the murder suspects) had approached Sharma at 5 pm on Saturday to hire his goods carrier, he turned it down saying that it was a no-entry time (for goods vehicles in the city). But they said that they would bear the challan, if caught,” he said.“Kishan strangled Khosla, but spared Saroj as she treated him well. But they had not decided on how to transport the body without anyone noticing. So, they emptied a double-door refrigerator of the Khosla family, stuffed the body in and drove away,” said the officer, adding that the police awaited Khosla’s autopsy report.Singh said that the men buried the body in the pit. “In between all this, they also used Khosla’s ATM cards to withdraw ₹40,000,” said Singh. The police arrested Kishan and another suspect from Uttar Pradesh, and three others from Delhi. At their instance, the location of the body was identified.Singh said that several questions have remained unanswered. “It is surprising that they made so much effort to move Khosla’s body in a refrigerator when they could have left it at the murder spot and escaped,” said ADCP Parvinder Singh.	A 29-year-old woman and a man were arrested for allegedly kidnapping a 12-day-old baby in the national capital, police said on Monday.

Ruby Khatoon was arrested from Saket while her accomplice Shah Mohammad was nabbed from Sangam Vihar area and the child was recovered, police said.

Khattoon had took the baby of her co-worker Meenakshi Sharma on the pretext of taking care of him, the police said.

In her complaint, Sharma told police, Ruby Khatoon and I worked in the same store. After I told her that I was pregnant, she told me that she wants a baby but couldn't conceive one. Later, she introduced me to her husband Rakesh Kumar. They told me that they wanted to take care of the baby and helped me during pregnancy. On September 17, I delivered the baby in a hospital in Delhi. On the same day, they asked to take away the baby. They told me that it was only for a few days and that I could contact them at any time. I gave them my child but after sometime when I tried to contact them they wouldn't take my calls.

The woman then searched for Khatoon and her husband. Through the neighbours, she came to know that Ruby wasn't married, the police said.

I came to know that she was in Saket Court with a man. I went there and saw her with Kumar. I confronted her about my child but she refused to tell me anything, said Sharma.

Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (South) said, ""We received a complaint that two women were fighting outside the court. The officers rushed to the court and found that Sharma's baby was kidnapped. We arrested Ruby who later told us that she gave the child to a man named Shah Mohammad. The man was arrested from Sangam Vihar and the baby was recovered from his possession.

The police said that Ruby went to the court to get married to Kumar.

Accused Says They Got Thrashed At Cafe

NEW DELHI: The sensational murder of a property dealer turned politician, who was shot dead in Dwarka on Tuesday by two assailants in a daring attack captured on CCTV camera, was a fallout of a fight that took place in a cafe run by the victim, police said after arresting one of the alleged shooters on Thursday.The victim, Narendra Gehlot, had contested the last municipal elections as an independent and lost. He had slapped the shooter, Nakul Sangwan, at his cafe after locking him up following an altercation, police said. Sangwan, who is the cousin of gangster Kapil Sangwan, was nursing a grudge against Gehlot ever since, and decided to eliminate him to avenge the insult, police added.Police arrested Sangwan near Dwarka on Thursday after laying a trap. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said a team led by ACP Rajinder Singh confronted Sangwan near Goyla Dairy. When he saw the police team, Sangwan tried to whip out his pistol and fire but was overpowered by the team. The .32 bore pistol he had used for the murder was recovered from him.Cops found that Sangwan was earlier involved in another murder in Aman Vihar near Rohini. The victim was a youth named Pushkar, whom Sangwan suspected of passing on information to his rivals about the movement of the family members of one of his associates. That murder too was captured in a CCTV camera.During interrogation, Sangwan told the cops that in July this year, he and his friend Rohit had gone to a cafe run by Gehlot’s relatives on the third floor of his office near Dwarka More. Rohit had a running dispute with Gehlot and his relative, claiming that he had lent them money for the cafe which Gehlot had refused to return.Finding them sitting in the cafe, Gehlot challenged them which led to an argument during which he allegedly shut the door and called in a few of his employees to thrash Sangwan and Rohit. Angered by the insult, Sangwan was looking for an oppurtunity to take revenge and had kept a watch outside Gehlot’s shop to track his movements, police said.On Tuesday, he and one of his associates waylaid Gehlot while he was leaving his shop, and started firing at his car. When Gehlot tried to flee, Sangwan climbed on a car parked near Gehlot’s car and shot him dead.Sangwan told cops that he had dropped out of a Haryana college while pursuing a BSc course. He was inspired by his cousin Kapil, who has been absconding for the past few years. He had joined Kapil’s gang and was a notorious sharpshooter of the Nandu gang. He was arrested last year in a murder case at Baba Haridass Nagar, and was released from the jail in June 2019. Sangwan had started extorting money from businessmen in Dwarka and adjoning areas.Police are now on the lookout for his associate, who had also fired at Gehlot.

The police said the four men were caught red-handed, while they were breaking a wall of the gold finance company’s office and were about to enter the premises. They had planned to break a locker that contained 18 kilograms of gold, ₹5 lakh and other valuables, the police said. Those arrested were identified as Panchu Ram Mandal, Pheku Basak, Mohijur, of Sahibganj in Jharkhand, and Nirjan Joshi of Nepal. The police recovered a countrymade pistol with one cartridge and house breaking equipment from the four. The deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said that the arrests came during the tenant verification drive in resettlement colonies. During one such drive, a team of the Shalimar Bagh police received information about a few men, who had recently rented a godown and a house. The information was developed and it was learnt that the men were often seen entering a godown, which is to the rear of the gold finance company’s office. Around 2.30pm on Sunday, the team checked around the building and found a man standing outside the godown. Seeing the police party, the man, Joshi, ran inside, but was caught. “Our team members checked the godown and found two men making a hole in the wall using spades. Another man was standing nearby with a spade in his hand. They were arrested,” said Arya. During questioning, the DCP said, the arrested men said they had planned to burgle the gold finance company office with the help of a person who had details of the office and its surroundings.“They rented the godown on rent so that they could bore a hole and enter the finance company office without getting caught. They chose Sunday since it was an off day. We are now looking for the person who played a key role in the planning,” said an investigator.	Four men, including a Nepal national, who allegedly attempted to burgle a gold loan finance company's office in Delhi's Shalimar Bagh were arrested, police said on Monday.

The accused were identified as Panchu Ram Mandal, Pheku Basak, Mohijur, residents of Jharkhand and Nirjan Joshi, a resident of Nepal, they said.

Police got a tip-off about some suspicious persons who had recently moved into the area, following which they checked around the Manappuram Gold loan office on Sunday at around 2.30 pm, a senior police officer said.

""At the office's back side, they saw Joshi standing outside a godown and on seeing the police, he ran inside the godown. Police chased Joshi and apprehended him. They checked inside the godown and found three persons making a manhole and trying to break the wall with help of spades. Later, they were also apprehended,"" said Vijayanta Arya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest).

Interrogation revealed that the accused hatched a conspiracy with their associate who had a complete knowledge about the finance company's office at Singalpur village in Shalimar Bagh and its surrounding area, the DCP said.

They took a godown, situated behind the Manappuram office, on rent around 10 days ago. They started breaking the wall of godown which led them into the bathroom of the office, the officer said.

They made a manhole inside the wall. The accused were arrested when they were about to enter their targeted office. The lockers in the premises reportedly contained around 18 kg gold and Rs 5 lakh cash along with other valuables, they said.

A case was registered against Kamal Dahiya, the owner of the rented premises, for not conducting tenant verification.

One country-made pistol, one live cartridge and some equipment used for housebreaking were recovered from their possession, police said, adding that efforts are being made to arrest the absconding accused.",-1	-1,0	0,67

According to the police, the accused, identified as Javed, was nabbed from North Delhi's Narela area. They have also seized one loaded country-made pistol from his possession, which was allegedly used to commission the crime.

""Considering the seriousness of the crime, many teams of Police were constituted by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP),"" the police said in a statement.

The 25-year-old was caught after the teams conducted raids at the ""possible hideouts"" of the accused at various places in New Delhi and Haryana.	Fifteen months after he shot dead three rival gangsters on a busy road in north Delhi’s Burari, Jitender Gogi — one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters — has allegedly been named in the daring shootout in Narela on September 8 in which Virender Mann, a history sheeter, was killed. Police claimed that witnesses has identified one of the shooters as Jitender Gogi. Along with two aides, Gogi allegedly intercepted Mann’s car and pumped in 20 bullets in his body. Police said Gogi was last seenin Burari shootout in which a passeby woman was also killed. He had been on the run. With at least a dozen cases, including murder and extortion, Gogi carries a reward of Rs 4 lakh on his arrest. He was last arrested in 2016, but had fled police custody within three months. Police have also registered a case under the stringent MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) Act against him. Police officers who are trying to hunt Gogi down said he does not use one phone for long and changes his hideouts almost every other day. Police have in the past traced his location to Nepal and the other neighbouring states in north India. A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said booking Gogi under MCOCA means that on his arrest, he will not be bailed out easily and other criminals or associates sheltering him will also be booked. Further, the stringent law allows police to attach his properties acquired through illegal means, further weakening the activities of his gang, the officer said requesting anonymity.Gogi’s involvements have surfaced in crimes such as murders, attempts to murder, extortion, possession of illegal arms, carjacking and land grabbing.Investigation in several cases against the gangster shows that it was Gogi, his right hand Kuldeep Fajja and their gang member Rohit Moi who were involved in September 8 shoot out in which Virender Mann was killed. The trio’s name also surfaced in Burari shootings last year .Gogi was not always the most feared gangster. He was once a bright student at Delhi university. It was while studying in Swami Shraddhanand College that Gogi developed enmity with another student, Sunil alias Tillu, whose associates had allegedly beaten Gogi’s friend who was contesting college elections. The rival candidate was Tillu’s cousin. Gogi’s friend then withdrew his name and Tillu’s cousin won the elections.This incident gave birth to an alleged rivalry between Gogi and Tillu that has claimed more than 10 lives from both the groups over the past decade. While Gogi, last arrested in 2016 managed to flee from police custody, Tillu is currently in jail.	The murder of Virender Mann, former BSP MLA candidate from outer Delhi’s Narela, who succumbed to at least 20-25 gunshot wounds earlier this month, was allegedly orchestrated by Delhi’s most wanted gangster Jitender Gogi and his associate Kapil Mann, police said Monday. Police said they have arrested Kapil for the murder and said Virender’s killing was a retaliation against another murder last year — an associate of Neeraj Bawana had allegedly gunned down one Babloo Kheda, who was Kapil’s uncle.On September 8, five men had reportedly intercepted Virender’s Hyundai Creta on Lampur Road in Outer Delhi’s Narela and sprayed 30-40 bullets at his car, while he was seated beside the driver. As many as 20-25 bullets hit Virender, killing him on the spot, while his driver miraculously escaped the firing.Virender, who had contested the assembly elections from Narela on a BSP ticket in 2013 and lost, had 13 cases registered against him, including those of murder, attempt to murder, robberies, extortion and under the Arms Act.A senior police officer probing Virender’s murder said they got sketches of suspects made with the help of locals and witnesses and found that Gogi and Kapil, who carries a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest, were present at the spot of the crime during the shooting.DCP(outer north) Gaurav Sharma said their surveillance led police teams to an input that Kapil, a resident of Kheda Khurd village, will be reaching Sector 34 near the Kheda canal on Sunday. “On this input, our special staff team laid a trap and Kapil was arrested. He was carrying a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest for his involvement in three murders, one attempt to murder, three robberies and one Arms Act case,” the DCP said.Sharma said during questioning, Kapil disclosed that on September 8, he and his men were tailing Virender’s car and when they saw Virender’s car stuck in a traffic jam, he and his associates fired indiscriminately at that vehicle. “Efforts to arrest the other suspects are being made. Among the other suspects, we have so far identified Kuldeep Fajja, who is Gogi’s confidant, and gang member Rohit Moi,” the DCP said.Another officer associated with the investigation said further interrogation of the arrested men revealed that Virender’s killing was the fallout of a murder that took place last year.“On July 31, 2018, 46-year-old Babloo Kheda was gunned down in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar. One Parvesh Mann, who was backed by gangster Neeraj Bawana, was the prime suspect. Later, in October, police arrested Parvesh Mann. Investigations revealed that the car in which he was arrested had been given to him by Virender. Kapil, the nephew of Babloo Kheda, came to know that Virender also had a role in his uncle’s murder. He told us that Virender was killed to settle scores with Bawana for plotting his uncle’s death,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.	The police on Sunday solved a murder case by arresting a criminal who was also wanted in seven other cases of murder.

""A team of special staff of Outer North district consisting of Sub Inspector Kamlesh, Assistant Sub Inspector Ombir, Head Constable Joginder, Constable Dinesh, Constable Hanuman and Constable Ravikant in the leadership of Inspector Ajay worked out the sensational murder case of Virender alias Kala with the arrest of one criminal Kapil Mann (25),"" DCP Outer North Delhi, Gaurav Sharma said.

Virender was killed after Mann fired at him indiscriminately near Sadabad in Narela.

The accused was carrying a reward of Rs 1,25,000 on his head. He has been arrested under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was wanted in eight cases of murder, attempt to murder and robbery etc.

He was arrested from Sector 34 area, near Kheda canal here.

Efforts are on to recover the weapon of offence. Further investigation is underway.	Greater Noida: A fake robbery and misbehaviour with a journalist turned the Dankaur police station into a protest site on Wednesday. First, a tractor driver allegedly made off with farmers’ money he claimed had been stolen. Then, a journalist who was covering the case was allegedly manhandled by a sub inspector.It started with Deepak Singh, 23, who was on his way back from a grain market in Delhi’s Narela after selling wheat on behalf of several farmers. Around 9.20am, Mukesh Tayal, the tractor owner, got a call from Deepak, telling him that the bag with Rs 6,7 lakh in cash had been looted by three men on a bike who overpowered him near Sports City. At 9.30am, police arrived at the spot. “Deepak claimed only Rs 4,000 was looted,” a senior police officer told TOI. Then, Tayal got there. Meanwhile, CCTV footage showed no bike around the tractor along the stretch. Police started searching the tractor and said Deepak fled during the search, while Tayal alleged they had deliberately let him go. Around 11am, Anshu Chauhan, a local journalist, reached to cover the case. “I was at Dankaur police station to find out about the case. I was sitting near a staircase when sub-inspector Dinesh Kumar started arguing with me, snatched my phone and smashed it. He thought I was trying to take a video. When I told him I was not, he held me by the collar,” Chauhan said.The news spread, a group of mediapersons told the Dankaur SHO what happened. But before he could arrive, local journalist Mustkin Khan said, constable clerk Pappu Khan abused them and threatened to jail them. The place then turned into a site of two protests – one by journalists and another by farmers, who had converged there demanding their money. Deepak was finally arrested near Palwal around 6am on Wednesday. The farmers were still on protest till late evening.An FIR has been lodged against Deepak for criminal breach of trust, SP (rural) Ranvijay Singh said. Tayal, however, told TOI he and another farmer spoke to Deepak, who said he had handed the money to the police. Singh said that the constable clerk had been transferred earlier. No action has been taken against the sub-inspector as of now.",25	-1	46	-1	-1,0	0	0	0	0,17

Accused Says They Got Thrashed At Cafe

NEW DELHI: The sensational murder of a property dealer turned politician, who was shot dead in Dwarka on Tuesday by two assailants in a daring attack captured on CCTV camera, was a fallout of a fight that took place in a cafe run by the victim, police said after arresting one of the alleged shooters on Thursday.The victim, Narendra Gehlot, had contested the last municipal elections as an independent and lost. He had slapped the shooter, Nakul Sangwan, at his cafe after locking him up following an altercation, police said. Sangwan, who is the cousin of gangster Kapil Sangwan, was nursing a grudge against Gehlot ever since, and decided to eliminate him to avenge the insult, police added.Police arrested Sangwan near Dwarka on Thursday after laying a trap. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said a team led by ACP Rajinder Singh confronted Sangwan near Goyla Dairy. When he saw the police team, Sangwan tried to whip out his pistol and fire but was overpowered by the team. The .32 bore pistol he had used for the murder was recovered from him.Cops found that Sangwan was earlier involved in another murder in Aman Vihar near Rohini. The victim was a youth named Pushkar, whom Sangwan suspected of passing on information to his rivals about the movement of the family members of one of his associates. That murder too was captured in a CCTV camera.During interrogation, Sangwan told the cops that in July this year, he and his friend Rohit had gone to a cafe run by Gehlot’s relatives on the third floor of his office near Dwarka More. Rohit had a running dispute with Gehlot and his relative, claiming that he had lent them money for the cafe which Gehlot had refused to return.Finding them sitting in the cafe, Gehlot challenged them which led to an argument during which he allegedly shut the door and called in a few of his employees to thrash Sangwan and Rohit. Angered by the insult, Sangwan was looking for an oppurtunity to take revenge and had kept a watch outside Gehlot’s shop to track his movements, police said.On Tuesday, he and one of his associates waylaid Gehlot while he was leaving his shop, and started firing at his car. When Gehlot tried to flee, Sangwan climbed on a car parked near Gehlot’s car and shot him dead.Sangwan told cops that he had dropped out of a Haryana college while pursuing a BSc course. He was inspired by his cousin Kapil, who has been absconding for the past few years. He had joined Kapil’s gang and was a notorious sharpshooter of the Nandu gang. He was arrested last year in a murder case at Baba Haridass Nagar, and was released from the jail in June 2019. Sangwan had started extorting money from businessmen in Dwarka and adjoning areas.Police are now on the lookout for his associate, who had also fired at Gehlot.

They lived in a small village called Tapukara near Alwar Rajasthan . After a few weeks, Shakuntala said yes to Singla’s proposal.However, their relationship didn’t go unnoticed for long as they were spotted by relatives while meeting in parks. This was in the autumn of 2010. As both were from different castes, their families were furious with the affair. Shakuntala’s family hurriedly searched for a groom and fixed her marriage.Singla, a transporter, was heartbroken. Shakuntala offered to elope, but Singla knew that would not work and they would be caught.Over the next few months, Singla extensively surfed the internet and watched movies and soap operas to zero in on a plan. On one weekend, he watched two movies — Humraaz and Helen of Troy — and instantly got inspired with the plots. He roped in his driver, Ganesh, by offering Rs 70,000 to carry out his plan.He then asked Shakuntala to get married to the man chosen by her family, but not develop physical relations with him. The plan was to execute a perfect murder so that they could live happily ever after.On February 8, Shakuntala got married to Ravi, a resident of Kapashera in southwest Delhi. As per the plan, she returned to her village just a day after marriage.In the next two weeks, Shakuntala, Singla and Ganesh finalised every minute detail of their plan and also did a dry run to make sure nothing went wrong. Shakuntala then reached Delhi on March 21, 2011. She stayed at her husband’s house, but told him that she had taken a vow not to get intimate with him for the goodwill of their marriage.The next day, the couple went for their first outing. The plan was to watch a movie and visit a relative. Ganesh passed by and Shakuntala stopped him for a ride. After a few minutes, Singla joined them and they drove past Samalakha.On the way, Singla revealed that he was Shakuntala’s old friend from their village. They dropped off Shakuntala at a relative’s place. Singla then asked Ravi to accompany him as he wanted to talk in private. After reaching a secluded spot, Singla and Ganesh strangled Ravi with a rope. They took the body to Tapukara and buried it. This spot was near Singla’s warehouse where he stored construction material.Meanwhile, when Ravi didn’t return, his father approached Kapashera police station. When Shakuntala was quizzed, she told police that Ravi had left her outside their relative’s house saying he would return in five minutes, but never did. After a month, on April 16, an FIR of abduction was lodged when police failed to get leads in the case. However, the family approached court and filed a Habeas Corpus writ. In October 2011, the case was transferred to Delhi Police’s Crime Branch For the next eight years, police got various leads that pointed towards the involvement of Shakuntala and her lover, but they couldn’t move ahead because of lack of evidence. Finally, a team led by deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Joy Tirkey tracked down Kamal and Ganesh. Shakuntala is still absconding.On Saturday morning, an earthmover was used in the presence of Tizara tehsil sub-divisional magistrate and Tapukara SHO to dig up 5-6 feet of the ground from which 25 bones of Ravi’s body were recovered.	Two men were arrested on Monday after the crime branch solved a nine-year-old case in which the accused kidnapped victim from Kapashera in Delhi, police said.

The deceased identified as Ravi was kidnapped in 2011.

The accused Kamal Singla along with his associate Ganesh had planned the entire plot of murder. They were arrested after police scrutinised the call details of the deceased's wife.

Singla murdered 22-year-old Ravi as he got married to his lover Shakuntala.

According to police, during the interrogation, Kamal revealed the planning of murder and accepted that he strangled Ravi at his farmhouse and took the corpse to Alwar in Rajasthan to bury it in a deep pit at a construction site. He also revealed that he promised Rs 70,000 to his associate to help him in the murder.

Learning about the development in the murder case, the main accused suspected that he might be arrested so he dugout Ravi's grave to destroy the remains.

Police are looking for Shakuntla who is missing for the past two years.Pieces of Ravi's 25 bones have been recovered and sent for DNA testing.	AHMEDABAD: It was a cold case that haunted the Delhi cops for eight years before it got cracked earlier this month – with cops arresting two of the primary suspects and finding bones of the murder victim within a fortnight.Ravi Kumar, a resident of Samalkha near Delhi, was reported missing by his father with Kapashera police station on March 23, 2011. A day earlier, Ravi had gone out with his wife Shakuntala to meet her sister. On the way, Ravi reportedly met someone and went in a car and was never seen again. An FIR was filed by Ravi’s father and a habeas corpus was also admitted to Delhi High Court.While Delhi cops had suspicion on Shakuntala, with whom Ravi had got married on February 8, and her alleged lover Kamal Singla, they could not find any clinching evidence against them. A lie-detection test on Shakuntala, Singla and Shakuntala’s brother Raju – who was under scanner as Singla had claimed to have met him on the day of the incident – in 2012 did not yield any conclusive result.Over next five years, the cat and mouse game continued between cops and perpetrators as fate of Ravi was uncertain. The suspects refused to undergo narco test, but Delhi police’s crime branch sought permission to perform brain electrical oscillation signature (BEOS) profiling for Singla and Raju. The test doesn’t require suspects to speak anything – the electrodes in a special cap attached to the skull record the brain activity to understand whether the person has experiential knowledge of the incident in question.",-1	9	-1,0	0	0,50

She narrated how Mallikarjuna gagged her and took her towards a deserted house and then assaulted her. Apart from explaining the horror in detail, she also identified the accused.Mallikarjuna, however, maintained he hadn’t committed any offence and prayed the court be lenient with him.

The accused in this case cannot be shown any mercy as he has committed a heinous offence,” she said.

Instructions are also being issued by Police Headquarters to check crime in the state. Also, action is being given to the culprits and rewards are given to those who do good work.

Despite this, the recent incidents of loot in the state have raised questions on crime control. During the last 8 months, there have been 359 big and small incidents of loot in Jharkhand. These figures are from the Jharkhand Police, which are from January to August.

Police is not afraid of criminals

If we talk about the incidents of loot and robbery, then despite the efforts of the police, criminals are constantly making people their victims. Police fear is less visible among criminals. Every day there is a loot incident somewhere. The robbers have killed the police.

Police has failed to identify gangs
The police has failed to identify the gang of criminals involved in the robbery. Because of which criminals are not caught after one or two incidents. Many other state gangs are also active in the state, who after fleeing the robbery incident migrate to another state. Due to which the police are also facing difficulty in catching the criminals of other states.

Banks and ATMs targeted by criminals
If you look at the recent months, the target of criminals in Jharkhand has been mainly banks and ATMs. Where criminals are carrying out the robbery in broad daylight. So on the other hand, the ATM is being stolen by breaking the ATM.

keshavpuram,2019-10-24,"SC awards life term to Sharda Jain for kidnapping, killing fellow Congress party councillor",kidnapping,"The Supreme Court Thursday awarded life sentence to Sharda Jain, a former Congress MCD councillor, and a co-accused for conspiring to abduct and kill her fellow party councillor Atma Ram Gupta over 17 years ago here.

Jain, the then councillor from Keshavpuram municipal ward in northwest Delhi, was accused of hatching a conspiracy to murder Gupta, a senior councillor from Trinagar, as she did not like his intimacy with another party corporator Memwati Barwala.

Gupta, who had gone with Jain on August 24, 2002, to attend a Congress rally at Ferozshah Kotla ground, was kidnapped and found murdered after five days in a canal in Bulandshar district of Uttar Pradesh.

A bench of Justices M M Shantanagoudar and Ajay Rastogi upheld the verdicts of the Delhi High Court and the Rohini Trial court finding Jain and co-accused Rajender guilty and asked them to surrender forthwith to serve the life term.

The top court, however, acquitted third accused Raj Kumar of the charges framed against him.

""Criminal Appeal...filed by Sharda Jain (A-1) is dismissed. The judgment and order of conviction passed against her stands affirmed for the offences under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) ...Vide order..., Jain was granted bail. Accordingly, her bail bonds are cancelled. She shall be taken into custody immediately to serve out the remainder of her sentence,"" the bench ordered.

The court noted that it was Jain who took police officials to the spot where the councillor was murdered.

""We do not find any valid ground to disbelieve their testimony, particularly when they are independent, unbiased police officials. There was no reason for them to falsely depose against Sharda Jain, who was also a public servant, being a Councillor of the MCD. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the circumstance of Sharda Jain pointing out the place of the murder of the deceased is proved,"" it said.

It also said the courts below are justified in concluding that the deceased was last seen in the company of Sharda Jain and ""that the time gap between the last seen and the time of the death of the deceased is so small so as to make it impossible for the deceased to come in the contact of any other person. Further, since no plausible explanation has been given by Sharda Jain as to how and when she parted company with the deceased"".

As per the prosecution, Gupta went missing on Augist 24, 2002 after he left his residence to go to the Congress Party's rally along with Jain at the Ferozshah Kotla Grounds.

""It is the case of the prosecution that Sharda Jain had developed close relations with the deceased. When he began ignoring her for another woman, she hatched a conspiracy with her brother, Raj Kumar and two other persons, Rajender and Roshan Singh to murder him,"" the court said.

The trial court, in 2006, had convicted Jain, Raj Kumar, Rajender and Roshan Singh and five others in the case for their varied roles.

The High Court affirmed the conviction of Sharda Jain, Raj Kumar, Rajender and Roshan Singh and had acquitted five others -- Pushpender, Nirvikar, Shri Pal Singh Raghav, Satender Kumar and Rakesh Kumar.

Roshan Singh died in 2010 and the case against him was abated.",-1,0,84
